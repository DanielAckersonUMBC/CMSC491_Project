This needs a project and engine setup like the assignments. There is a MaterialExtensions.ush file so a modified engine is necessary. I'm using the gitignore that I used in my assignment repo, but since there seems to have been problems with that repo (the TA couldn't run it and I couldn't after cloning either), I can't guarntee that this project will work on its own. It may require manually adding the files to a fresh project. 

Goal of project: Make a candle flame material using perlin curl.  Originally, I wanted to make a flame, which could have used texture advection. I dropped this idea in favor of making a candle instead of a torch. With this, the plan was now to lerp from hot to cold color of candle flame, locked to a vector from the object to the camera. For this, I would use the position vector of the object and the position vector of the camera and substract and normalize. Then I would dot product the result with the vector from the center of the obect to the surface for a particular pixel, or rather, the surface normal. Also, I want to make the candle emissive and emit light on the environment.

While I could get the camera and object position, I couldn't figure out the surface normal in time. Also, I could not get light to emit on the environment even after following simple instructions I found online, so I opted for a point light component of the candle flame object.
The candle flame object is just a sphere scaled to look like an ovoid.
